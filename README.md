# Github users autocomplete search

This project is a demo for a React search field component with autocomplete functionality. As the user types, GitHub users will show up in the autocomplete results.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing and running the project locally

After cloning the project, run the following in the project directory:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

### Rate limit

To increase the rate limit when running the project locally, please rename the .env.example file to .env and add your own Github Client ID and Client secret. The solution also works without this step.

Please read more details about this subject here: [Github Search API Rate Limit](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/search#rate-limit)
